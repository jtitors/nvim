# Neovim Environment
This project is a WIP.
The main purpose is to build my Neovim environment from scratch on my way to become a developer.
As of starting this project, I have no knowledge about Vim / Neovim configuration, nor Lua.
I will be working on this environment while keeping in mind both Linux and Windows compatibility (hence the messy skeleton configuration).
